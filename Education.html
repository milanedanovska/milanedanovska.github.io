                I started my schooling at Kiril Pejčinovič primary school in Skopje, Kisela Voda.
                Then I enrolled in the high school Josip Broz-Tito, where I studied in the special
                German class of the natural mathematics major. During my schooling, I acquired knowledge
                in the field of mathematics, informatics and the German language, which have always been a field
                of my interest. In the fourth year, I received a certificate for B2/C1 level in German.
                After finishing high school, I decided to continue my studies at the Faculty of Information
                Sciences and Computer Engineering. I have now completed my first year here, and I am looking forward to learning many new
                things in this field <span id="span">during my studies.</span>
